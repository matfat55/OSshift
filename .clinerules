# OSshift Project Rules

## Project Patterns

### Documentation Standards

- Memory bank files should be kept up-to-date with all project decisions
- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include clear section headers for easy navigation
- Use checklists for tracking progress items

### Development Workflow

- Document all significant changes in activeContext.md
- Update progress.md with completed items and new tasks
- Review memory bank before starting new development work

### Project Structure

- Organize code by functional components
- Keep UI logic separate from business logic
- Maintain clear separation between AI integration and application core

## User Preferences

- Prefer concise, technical explanations
- Focus on practical implementation details
- Document architectural decisions with clear rationales

## Implementation Guidelines

- Prioritize minimal resource usage
- Ensure responsive UI even during AI processing
- Secure all user data, especially API keys
- Design for extensibility to support multiple AI providers

## Tool Usage

- Document all third-party libraries and their purposes
- Prefer established libraries for security-critical functions
- Minimize dependencies to keep the application lightweight

## Known Challenges

- Global hotkey capture may require system-level permissions
- Balancing UI responsiveness with AI processing time
- Secure storage of API keys on the local system
- Managing different AI provider response formats

This file will be updated as we learn more about the project and establish additional patterns and preferences.
