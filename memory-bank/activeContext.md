# Active Context for OSshift

## Current Work Focus

The project is in its initial planning and setup phase. We are establishing the foundational documentation and defining the core requirements before beginning implementation.

## Recent Changes

- Created the memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Defined the project brief with basic requirements
- Established product context, system patterns, and technical context

## Next Steps

- Determine the specific technology stack for implementation
- Create initial project structure and repository setup
- Implement the global hotkey system for right shift detection
- Develop the basic UI for the chat interface
- Implement API key management and AI provider integration

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Choosing between Electron, WPF, or other frameworks for the UI implementation
- Determining the best approach for global hotkey handling on Windows
- Deciding on secure storage methods for API keys
- Considering the user experience flow for first-time setup
- Evaluating different AI providers to support initially

## Open Questions

- What specific AI providers should be supported in the initial release?
- Should chat history be stored locally by default?
- What is the minimum Windows version that should be supported?
- Should there be a visible indicator when the application is running in the background?
- What customization options should be available to users?
