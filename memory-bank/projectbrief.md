# Open source Shift

## brief description

Open source shift is a desktop project. Currently only planned for Windows. It's a software that's always on your window, in a small window. It can be hidden, and brought back with a press of right shift. It's an ai assistant. The window is a chat panel, in which the user may talk to an ai. The ai can respond appropriately. The ai usage is client side, they provide their own API keys
